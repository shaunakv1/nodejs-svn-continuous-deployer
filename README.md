A continuous deployment module for node.js that reads SVN repos and deploys them based on a deploy.js file in the project root.


Download and run `npm install`, to install all dependencies.

This Project is in development and not ready for active duty!


Module I am looking at to get this done:

SVN Bindings:
https://npmjs.org/package/svn-spawn

A flat file DB and ORM
http://sequelizejs.com/

Forever to run continously run the script in background without user login
